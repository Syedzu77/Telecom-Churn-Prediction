# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“Š
Machine learning project to predict **telecom customer churn** using the [Kaggle 2020 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview).

----

# Project Overview
Context: Based on the Kaggle 2020 Customer Churn Competition
Problem: Customer churn leads to significant revenue losses in telecom.
Goal: Build predictive models to identify churners and analyze key features influencing churn.
Business Impact: Helps telecom companies design targeted retention strategies.

# Results
- **Best Model:** XGBClassifier  
  - Accuracy: **95%**  
  - Recall: **75%**  
- **Key Features Driving Churn:**  
  - `total_day_charge`  
  - `customer_service_calls`  
  - `total_eve_charge`  
  - `total_night_charge`  
  - `international_plan`

ðŸ‘‰ Customers with *high charges* and *frequent service calls* are at higher risk of leaving.
